    <p style="font-size:18px;">
        <b>Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ, DL</b> (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930)
        was a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock 
        Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and 
        fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes 
        stories are milestones in the field of crime fiction.
        Doyle was a prolific writer. In addition to the Holmes stories, his works 
        include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger, 
        and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well
        as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's
        early short stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise
        the mystery of the Mary Celeste.
