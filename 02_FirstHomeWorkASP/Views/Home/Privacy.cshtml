    Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 at 11 Picardy Place, Edinburgh,
    Scotland. His father, Charles Altamont Doyle, was born in 
    England, of Irish Catholic descent, and his mother, Mary (née Foley),
    was Irish Catholic. His parents married in 1855. In 1864 the family
    scattered because of Charles's growing alcoholism, and the children were 
    temporarily housed across Edinburgh. Arthur lodged with Mary Burton, the 
    aunt of a friend, at Liberton Bank House on Gilmerton Road, while studying 
    at Newington Academy.
    In 1867, the family came together again and lived in squalid tenement flats
    at 3 Sciennes Place. Doyle's father died in 1893, in the Crichton Royal,
    Dumfries, after many years of psychiatric illness. Beginning at an 
    early age, throughout his life Doyle wrote letters to his mother, and many
    of them were preserved.
    Supported by wealthy uncles, Doyle was sent to England, to the Jesuit preparatory 
    school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst in Lancashire, at the age of nine (1868–70).
    He then went on to Stonyhurst College, which he attended until 1875. While
    Doyle was not unhappy at Stonyhurst, he said he did not have any fond memories
    of it because the school was run on medieval principles: the only subjects 
    covered were rudiments, rhetoric, Euclidean geometry, algebra, and the classics.
    Doyle commented later in his life that this academic system could only be excused 
    "on the plea that any exercise, however stupid in itself, forms a sort of mental
    dumbbell by which one can improve one's mind". He also found the school harsh, 
    noting that, instead of compassion and warmth, it favoured the threat of corporal
    punishment and ritual humiliation.
	From 1875 to 1876, he was educated at the Jesuit school Stella Matutina in Feldkirch,
    Austria. His family decided that he would spend a year there in order to perfect 
    his German and broaden his academic horizons. He was raised Catholic but later
    rejected the faith and became an agnostic. One source attributed his drift away 
    from religion to the time he spent in the less strict Austrian school. He also 
    later became a spiritualist mystic.
